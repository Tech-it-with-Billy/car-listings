# 🚗 Kenya Used Car Market Analysis – Jiji.co.ke Web Scraping Project

## 📌 Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the used car market in Kenya using data scraped from [Jiji.co.ke](https://jiji.co.ke/cars), one of the country’s largest online car marketplaces. The goal is to provide data-driven insights to help buyers, sellers, and industry stakeholders make informed decisions.

We use **Selenium** to scrape real-time listings and extract relevant details such as price, make, model, year, mileage, condition, location, and seller type. The data is stored in a **PostgreSQL database**, processed with **Pandas**, and visualized using **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Plotly**.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

> **What factors most influence the pricing and availability of used cars in Kenya, and how can these insights help buyers and sellers make better decisions?**

---

## ❓ Key Research Questions

* What is the resale value of a specific car brands and models in Kenya?

* What are the most in-demand cars in specific regions?

* Is there a preferred price range that buyers are targeting?

* What regions or cities have the highest and lowest average car prices for a specific model?

* How does transmission type (automatic vs manual) affect vehicle pricing and availability?#

* Which color variants are most common and do they influence car pricing?#

* Are cars listed by enterprise sellers priced differently than those by individual sellers?#

* What are the most and least listed car brands and models on Jiji.co.ke?#

* Are there seasonal or temporal patterns in car listings and pricing trends on the platform?
